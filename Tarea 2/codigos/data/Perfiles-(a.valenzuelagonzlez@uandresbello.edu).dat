When my life settles down a little, I'd like to become more politically active. Lastly, I have 2 cats and I love animals. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm currently a full time EMT and a casual hairdresser. I was looking to get out of EMS at one point but I'm really enjoying my job again and I'd like to stick around for a couple more years. I'm single right now and although single life has it's perks, I would love to settle down with the right person. And to all you pervs out there, I don't believe in casual sex and refuse to do that with anyone that I dont care about. I have my morals and my personal code and I don't break it, EVER.

CYWL7JCH2SO7XSCOHGY2YIAKFA	Some of my fav quotes.... <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Thoughts become words. Words become actions. Actions become habits. Habits become character. And character becomes your destiny. <br> <br/> -Unknown <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm going to get through this; I'm going to be fine. The power to do it is all in my mind. <br> <br/> -Cindy Wagner <br> <br/> <br> <br/> “No one means all he says, and yet very few say all they mean, for words are slippery and thought is viscous.”- Henry Adams. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> "Never be afraid to try something new. Remember that a lone amateur built the Ark. A large group of professionals built the Titanic." <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I object to violence because when itz appears to do good, the good is only temporary; the evil it does is permanent. <br> <br/> -Gandhi <br> <br/> <br> <br/> "Let's think the unthinkable, let's do the undoable, let's prepare to grapple with the ineffable itself, and see if we may not eff it after all." Douglas Adams <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Illegal aliens have always been a problem in the United States. Ask any Indian. <br> <br/> - Robert Orben

CXHMSYQV4SH7OA47G65UTDB5KE	Wildlife and the natural world are my main interests. I am closer to the other species on the planet than I am humans. I could do alot to protect what is left of the natural habitats and wildlife around the world if I was not trapped here in this bad situation. I was not meant to be here. I use to rescue, raise, catch and release wildlife. I also took care of many exotic animals as well. Some were domestic and others were wildlife at one time but could not be returned to the wild. I use to do some nature photography as well. I did not get payed for anything that I did. I used my own money. When out in natural habitats, I would also go caving. I have been trying to leave this horrible place for twenty years and go to California. I should be saving habitats and wildlife around the world but I could never get help and my bad luck has kept me here in this death trap of a town where there is nothing. I also have untreated medical problems. You don't get help in this town.

CUIAAQIDRUBICXPO24FZISYGW4	Without too much personal information, I'd like to share with you, a little about myself. Currently a student, I am working towards a M.S./Physician Asst. A physician's assistant is much like a nurse practitioner. Academically we differ slightly, I follow a medical module (medical school) where as N.P.'s follow nursing module (nursing school). I have two semesters and my preceptorship to complete before graduating in fall 2012. My goal is to one day run a C.C.U./I.C.U. For the time being I am an emergency room technician. Although work, clinical hours and schooling take up 99% of my time I do enjoy other activities, mostly surfing, snowboarding, hiking, diving, and occasionally dining out. I am a health freak, I run 3-5 miles at least 3 times a week, and follow a strict diet, don't smoke or drink. Yahoo answers is also one of tools of procrastination, hopefully my answers are found useful. Feel free to e-mail me with personal medical questions or ques about PA career!

JQBPPYLTF4DIOYRLMFHJ34TJXU	The details of my life are quite inconsequential.... very well, where do i begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it
JIIZENA2OEEW7TLX7KPIL3JKVU	I'm 16 years old and live in St. Louis, Missouri. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I play baseball competitively and run cross-country at my school. I love playing almost any sport for fun, though (basketball, football, etc.) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My main hobbies are sports, reading, playing xbox, and hanging out with my friends. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> As far as music I enjoy classic rock for the most part (The Who, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, etc.). I listen to some rap music, but mainly rock is on my ipod. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My favorite sports teams are the St. Louis Cardinals and the St. Louis Blues; I usually catch a handful of games every year. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> So that's a little bit about me, and feel free to email me or add me to your contacts list.

J7NZOC6LAI3NJN5QE6VL4BWLOA	I turned 38 at Christmas '07. I'm married with three grown step-children and now a two year old son. I'm a stay-at-home Mom these days. I am a recovering addict with nearly eighteen years of sobriety. My drug of choice was cocaine. <br> <br/> I'm nzot an expert at anything and you'll never hear me claim to be. I DO have very strong opinions and when I give you advice it comes from years worth of experience doing EVERYTHING stupid and wrong and then having to learn that my way was wrong and to do things the right way. Such is the nature of the substance abuser. <br> <br/> Animals are my passion. I run a small animal rescue in small town america(pop 3500). I saved my first animal, a mole, when I was six years old. This is my calling. Call me crazy but I'm "connected" to these creatures...somehow. I am a true lover of animals and the lives of ALL of them are of equal importance to me. All of them deserve a chance to live. Working to keep them alive has taught me much...about animals AND myself.

Still, I do give 100%, so give me some credit for that. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I like the color purple, walking barefoot on the streets, rainy days, getting up at sunrise, being by a body of water around sunset, NYC, Hollywood, plane trips, romance, over-sized sweatshirts, loud concerts that blast your ears, and being helpful as often as possible. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> So I had two of my questions removed from this site.

To be completely honest, I am a spoiled teenager, but I don't let that get to my head and affect my life. It wasn't always like that. I like math and learning about the human behaviors. I am an interesting person once you get to know me, or at least I think I am. Haha.

EI6NRNTWV7V7AEAQSGY2AC4EQ4	I'm a 13 year old Christian girl who lives in USA. I love Jesus, more than anything or anyone. <3 <br> <br/> <br> <br/> First of all, Michael Jackson is one of my all-time favorite singers. I love his music, his dancing, and his personality. My favorite song by him is Man in the Mirror, because it sends out such a wonderful message. Even though he has many haters, and many rumors spread about him, us fans know it isn't the truth. RIP Michael! <3 <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Second of all, another one of my favorites is Justin Bieber. But I'm not one of those fans who say he's as good as Michael. Michael preformed his whole life, and Justin just started. His voice could change. Michael's changed, but in a good way, and I hope that will be the same with Justin. But I personally do think he's good, love his songs, and I think he's hot <3. Don't judge me, because I don't care. I love who I want and it won't change. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you agree with me on anything, or want to be friends, add me as a contact! <br> <br/> xoxoxoxoxo, <br> <br/> Angel <3

God, it was almost an artform!
VY7UGTRCLDL33PQ3O2C57LIEXQ	Army Vet..former boxer....studied bjj/judo...last good book is Che...i think that weed should be legal. The tax we could make off of it would help the economy. People are going to smoke anyway, why not make money off it it instead of spending up to 50 to 60k a year just to keep an inmate in jail for selling an ounce of weed. Alcohol and tabacoo are worse. I am an ordained minister and have no problems with smoking a little to help me sleep. The Bible even tells us those our Lord has provided us with everything we need. It has been used for medicinal purposes for hundreds of year. Put some weed in a bottle with alcohol and let it set for awhile. There is nothing better for soreness. Mexico has used this remedy for such a long time.

I dabble in all forms of the arts seeing as thats where my intelligence seems to have taken me. I play the bass clarinet and am trying to learn keyboard but am held back by a gimpy left hand.

I am also helping to inform others about the true identites of a self-injurer and trying to make this disease more socially acceptable. If you don't like my scars or my lifestyle look away and ignore them. They were never your problem in the first place:)

Devout Republican, Devout Conservative <br> <br/> I make no apoligies for my Christianity. God is God all by himself, and His existance zis not contingent upon your belief in Him, Nor is He wringing his hands over what He will do about your disbelief. I find it uniqely ironic, that the liberal that preaches tolerance and diversity, will not tolerate those of faith, who believe in an absolute right and wrong, the absolute sanctity of life, and a God, that absolutely holds man accountable. <br> <br/> Anti Immigration <br> <br/> Anit socialist <br> <br/> Anti communist <br> <br/> Anti LIberal <br> <br/> Anti Abortion <br> <br/> Anti Gay marriage <br> <br/> Anti green movement <br> <br/> Anti islam embracing <br> <br/> Pro gun <br> <br/> Pro Life <br> <br/> Heterosexual <br> <br/> Proud Father. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Liberals prove to me every day that the "fairness" and "tolerance" they preach are non existant unless it supports the liberal agenda. Calling your self a prgressive is alot like a blind man calling himself a visionary

We believe He will one day return to thzis earth in power and glory. <br> <br/> I believe in the ministry of the Holy Spirit who shows us when we sin, and helps us to turn from sin to godly living. <br> <br/> I believe that God has not rejected Israel. Therefore, for the sake of God, I offer friendship and support to the Jewish people throughout the world. <br> <br/> I believe that the church was created by Jesus and that He is its leader. <br> <br/> I believe that one day all people will spend eternity in either heaven or hades.

6JNJZCR4FZWZKPFIHQIYC3KM5A	"Moderate/Independent" I support: equal, not "special rights", gay rights (including marriage), women's rights, a livable minimum wage, drug decriminalization, equality, and the right to choose. <br> <br/> I also, however support a vigilant stance on fighting terrorism, feel that Muslim terrorists are misguided, and we need to stop appeasing them. I support Israel, as it is the only civilized country in the middle east. And cannot grasp the left's blind support of Islam, whose values are anything but liberal. Political Correctness and lack of satirical thought is what is slowly destroying America and our way of lizfe. I try not to take anything too seriously, especially where Politics and Government are concerned

6KXIAKIUQB5Q5QYFYWCZPIJP4E	I'm a student journalist, a writer and an adventurer at heart. Fortune favors the bold and time waits for no one, so I seize every opportunity I can to experience something new and exciting. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm fond of deep conversations. Sometimes I pose arguments that go against my beliefs just to see how others react to them and think. This lets me learn more about other people, myself and my own beliefs. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I like to inspire people to find their own greatness and I enjoy having a positive impact on the lives of others. I like to joke around and have a good time and I like making people laugh, which I do very often. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I see myself as the main character in my own story of life while surrounded by billions of other stories. At the same time, I see myself as a supporting character in the stories of others which all add up to a greater story. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am the wind and the trees. The sky and the Earth. The ocean and the universe. Yet a single grain of sand in the dessert. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am me.

UH5QTP7XGEE37WTYLGT3HQU42U	I'm 50 years old, married and have two grown daughters, one aged 27 and the other 22 whom I love dearly.I was born and live in Nova Scotia, Canada. <br> <br/> I feel I have alot to offer to those who are seeking answers to questions (especially regarding spirituality/religion). I have always had faith in God even as a child. <br> <br/> I have been actively studying the Bible everyday for 12 years now with a very good Bible teaching ministry called the Shepherd's Chapel out of Gravette Ark. U.S.A. <br> <br/> It truly has been a huge blessing to me and continues to be so everyday.I enjoy helping people zwho want to help themselves.I'm a realist,I believe in The Creator,and the creation, not evolution. Evolution is not factual, and is only a theory,and to this day cannot be proven. <br> <br/> The Bible however is like reading tomorrow's newspaper if you have eyes to see and ears to hear, but sometimes you have to close your earthly eyes in order to see with your spiritual eyes.Hope this helps you to understa

UZ4ANH3WLDBY77UV4XKCP5HBUQ	My daughter is a professional dancer. I worked for NYCB (New York City Ballet.) If you are a serious dancer & want real answers, ask your questions at the Ballet Talk for Dancers website. <a href="http://dancers.invisionzone.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://dancers.invisionzone.com/index.ph...</a> BTFD is moderated by professional dancers & misinformation is removed. There is too much misinformation on YA and some of it is down right dangerous to follow. Many times BA is chosen by the asker because it is what they WANT to hear & not the correct information. I answer mostly to help young dancers from getting hurt, but it seems to be a loosing battle. I also try to help steer them in the right direction if they have real aspirations for a career in dance.There are people on this site calling themselves professionals that are not. No "real" working professional ballet dancer has time to be a top contributor on this site. <br> <br/> Sorry, I don't do contacts.

U2SBCMHGSRHD7WFNGFMWOETBBM	I'm an intelligent guy without a degree, politically-moderate and tenaciously-so, very independent by nature and something of a contrary who sees the truth - usually accurately - seldom rationalizes and believes in behaving proactively. - A stitch in-time, at the right place and sewn in the right way can save, like, 1000 stitches ... But we seldom behave proactively. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I don't like alot of what I see and it's hard to remain optimistic or sanguine about it. I hope for the best but truly believe the worst is yet to come. I can't believe, for example, that we're actually rebuilding New Orleans and asking everyone to come back and resume living 25 feet below sea-level right next to the Ocean. ("Hello!?") I can't be the only one who feels this way ... <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Things are moving faster and faster, faster and faster. Soon they'll be impossible for anyone to control, direct, spin or smile-about. There's really nothing to do, though, but keep fighting the good fight and love while you can.

U3WJO4TGSC6HWTWXTXKFKVI4BI	I am a 54 (in 2012) year old California native woman. I have had a life full of crap (unwed mother at 16, son's death a year later, suicidal depression, drug abuse, discovering I was gay at 19, etc.) I have been successful at overcoming a world of things, and have kept my 'eyes wide open' all my life trying to figure out why s#$t happens and how to deal with it successfully. I love helping others, especially teens, as they seem to still be the most mis-understood age group, as well as being the most discounted. (Opinions discounted because 'you're just being a teenager') Also, I remember. It blows me away how many adults don't remember how adolescence felt, or believe if it didn't bother them, it shouldn't bother their kids. Or, the old standby, "I went through that when I was your age, and I turned out all right."

UYZXVTROH2SVE7DO72U6X24WK4	I was born in Charleston, SC, on June 16, 1953. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I played two sports while at Carlisle Military School and graduated as my class Salutatorian. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I graduated from the University of South Carolina (cum laude) in 1976 with a dezgree in History and Political Science. I received my Master’s Degree in Accounting from USC in 1977. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> After finishing college, my first job was as a Staff Accountant with a nationally known accounting firm. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In 1980 through 1996, I worked in various capacities in upper management and also owned a construction business. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> With so many CPAs in Charleston, I had to differentiate myself from the others by finding a specialty area to concentrate my practice. It happened when a new bookkeeping client I had just acquired in May of 1996, came to me owing the IRS $90,000. We settled his debt through the Offer in Compromise program. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I started JK Harris in 1997. Through the hard work and dedication of our employees we became the nation’s largest tax resolution company.

My branch of seismology focuses on using earthquakes to find out about the Earth's insides. Most of my work deals with earthquakes in Africa.

I also like to learn about other cultures & other languages. I've been an English tutor for non-native speakers for around 6-7 years. Some day, I hope to become certified to teach English on the side. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My other hobbies include reading fiction (and non-fiction sometimes). I especially enjoy reading the classics, stories set in other cultures, and the Harry Potter series. I like to cook (mostly things that are bad for you ^_^), play board games with friends, hike/jog on trails, and generally try new things.

WXUUIUNRFP2RWRUSYCJTXSAEHA	My wife and I moved to Tobago March 2007. I was living in New York City for the last 6 years and in Virginia before that so it's a big change for me. I'm a carpenter by trade but I love to cook with all these fresh local foods. We buy fresh fish almost everyday when the local fishermen bring their days catch to a roadside table by the beach we like to swim at. Always wanted to try living on a tropical island. It's quite wonderful and affordable too. We like bicycle riding, swimming in the sea and waterfall pools, snorkeling, hiking in the rain forest, photography, yoga, travel, snow skiing and eating fresh tasty food. This island is a perfect fit.

Or so she wants me to think. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I don’t personally produce anything. Well, that is not entirely true. I produce many things, but I never let them out of my private collection. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> T.J.

WOAHVD66BNFAZSXQZ7WKQGHBXM	Hello :) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My name is Martin, I'm 21, half Danish, half Polish, living in Denmark. I'm currently a college student, studying law, which is something that interests me immensely. I love to read and learn about virtually everything - from the natural sciences to social sciences and the humanities - books are my alma mater! <br> <br/> My greatest love, however, is and has always been philosophy. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm not a guy that wants much from life, if I found the right girl then that's pretty much all I need to be happy. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I like to think of myself as a kind and sincere person and that's what I value most in people, although it has to be said that I'm a pretty shy guy, so my good qualities probably don't shine through right away. :)

W7O4JXHDUE2UM73L32IN5HVPWA	I am 21 French Canadian, Atheist, <br> <br/> <br> <br/> “Naturally the common people don't want war; neither in Russia, nor in England, nor in America, nor in Germany. That is understood. But after all, it is the leaders of the country who determine policy, and it is always a simple matter to drag the people along, whether it is a democracy, or a fascist dictatorship, or a parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is to tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for lack of patzriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country.” <br> <br/> Hermann Göring(Nazi) 1946 Nuremberg Trials <br> <br/> <br> <br/> "We are on the verge of a global transformation.

GW7QCXPEYT2ZTWLRTSQKK4MLKA	I grew up a GI brat and as I was of age to really start remebering things, I fell in Love with aircraft. I like to bowl, fish, and do flight simulators on my pc. I am not great at it but I enjoy flying in the real world or on pc. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I haven't been fishing or bowling in a long time because of health issues. Yahoo question and answers has become more interesting the past few days. Even though I am not great on the flight simulator I have a lot of fun & disapointment which goes with the game. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am a Vietnam Vet and I can relate to the men and women coming back from the Middle East. They are in my prayzers every day and night. I encourge all that read my profile to do the same.

GYX43I6IYPWQN3DEY7TY55LTUU	I'm a part-time musician (singer/ keyboards) living in Washington DC and working at a hospital. <br> <br/> I am a Christian, but a "New Thought" Christian. I honor everyone's right to choose whatever belief structure works for them. It's none of my business!!!!! But I like having interesting discussions about various topics. <br> <br/> I do not, on the other hand, have a whole lot of tolerance for people who are haters - so I've blocked a few people, because reading their hate-mongering responses actually makes me kind of nauseous. <br> <br/> You don't have to believe what I believe, but I would hope you can be respectful. <br> <br/> I am also gay - so if you don't believe in equal rights for all, you may not be interested in my opinion about anything. <br> <br/> And I love a good joke - and especially questions that start with "Spiritually speaking..."

2ET2HDNI6ABALCY2KKAPTD4PSU	Hey everyone! Sebastian here. I'm a PhD student in math and computer science up in Canada, and my goal is to be a teacher. I love teaching math and helping people to understand how it works, because there are loads of really cool and beautiful things in mathematics! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I try to give long answers where I show all my work and go through all my steps slowly and carefully to try to help you understand as best as possible. If I answer your question and there are parts of my solution you don't understand, please let me know and I'll do what I can to make it clearer and to help you! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> EDIT: I'm sorry I had to make all my settings private. Someone on here was going through my list of answers and giving a thumbs down to all of them for no reason (maybe because I get a lot of "best answers"). That was upsetting because I'm not here for the points; I take a lot of time to try to help people understand and love math like I do.

The constitution was also A divinely inspired document. Conservatism best reflects the founding fathers vision for america. Americans will someday stand accountable before God for how they discharged their political duties. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> There is only one true church. Each church is different, yet each church claims god's authority, <br> <br/> They are all different, and Either only one is true, or they are all wrong, <brz> <br/> There is only 1 true church. <br> <br/> God Lives. We are his children, we are responsible to him for our actions.These things are true Wether or not we accept he is real or not. Just cause you've never seen him, doesn't mean he's not there. I've never seen your brain, but you would probally ask me to accept that it's there, even if U can offer me no proof wouldn't you? <br> <br/> Utah was once the greatest state in America.

BKGEKR6VH5EEUDJ6KLFNT34RAQ	Since last I was on here, much has happened in my life to change many of my beliefs and goals. I began my path as a Christian, born and raised in a fundamentalist Baptist family, then when a life-changing event happened in 2012, I converted to Wicca. Since then, my life has changed rapidly and due to an experience with the Goddess Sigyn, I became a hard polytheist and chose to follow the Northern Tradition Pagan path (which quite a few Asatruar and heathens have a problem with but I think a lot of the Gods are misunderstood though others certainly aren't). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I have an Associate in Arts with emphasis on world religions/mythology and history from a US women's college and will be getting trained as a librarian soon enough. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am also currently engaged.

7TI7UYLXJJKKJDVJMVENQ6NY5I	Hey there. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Even though you'll probably see me in the Adolescence section the most, I probably have more knowledge to give in the New York City section. I live on 84th street and Park Ave. and have lived there my entire life (I'm only 15). I commute to school every morning two blocks from my apartment but I still have just as good of a knowledge of the NYC subway system as anyone else in the world. But that's because I have a photographic memory and looked at a map of the subways when I was 5... now I know it :) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm a true New Yorker; I love the Yankees, Giants, Knicks, and Rangers and attend as many games as I can. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I love to help people out, and I hope I can help you out one day! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Sincerely, <br> <br/> 84th and Park

Although I am typically a listing agent, I have a long list of happy buyer clients who refer other clients to me. Over $150 million sold in real estate. My favorite type of property is the mid-century ranch home, typically a three or four bedroom and two bath. These homes tend to be solidly built and easily updated for the modern era.

I have flipped houses too, and my favorite was the mid-century I bought and kept somewhat original but brought it modern too. Email me if you have any flip questions, by the way! You're talking to a true professional.

H2B7GIYPKQMNYX65PSE7MMS5YE	Hey There Y'all! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Politics and government are my favorite areas, so you'll probably not see me answering any questions in too many other areas. I'm deeply involved in politics in my county of Travis here in the heart of Texas. I'm the Democratic precinct chair for my voting precinct, I've served as an election judge in prior elections, and have volunteered on numerous campaigns. Although I live in a very Red state, I'm fortunate enough to live in one of the few BLUE counties in all of Texas. We are like the island of BLUE surrounded by a sea of Red. Anyway, I guess you could say then politicsz and government are my lifeline and that I'm almost obsessed with them! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Anyway, I have a wonderful family and have worked at The University of Texas at Austin for the last 8 years, also from where I graduated a year ago as a government major. I moved here from Houston in 1999 and have lived in Texas my entire life. Wouldn't want to be anywhere else! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Hook 'em Horns!!

Iran- You fuck e rs helped out the Lebanese carry out that attack, you help our enemies in Iraq, and have the gall to deny it while pursuing nuclear weapons. You are wrong in fearing the Israelis, the Marines already have their bayonets with your name carved on them. We'll "give" them to you soon enough... <br> <br/> 3. Pakistan- U fu ck e rs think you are so brave in bending over for the Taliban. Musharaff at least had the balls to fight them. Now because of your new "democratic" gov. my brothers in Afghanistan are dying. Ur nukes don't scare me either, u will all be dead before you can say shi----....

TRTTEIPYTKB5LRN6AXV7TWMZ5A	ARMY wife! Psychology degree. Owner of a yorkie named Rigel. I am an avid dog lover & a bit of a snob about dog food & treats. And I will block you if you say teacup dogs exist. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> When the power of love overcomes the love of power, the world will know peace. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> An apatheist is a type of atheist who, rather than not believing in any gods because the arguments for them are weak, simply doesn't care about the existence of any gods and goes about life as if none existed. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Religion is a disease of the mind, born of fear, which has done nothing but bring untzold misery down upon the human race. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> "I contend that we are both atheists. I just believe in one less god than you do. When you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods, you will understand why I dismiss yours." -Stephen F. Roberts <br> <br/> <br> <br/> America isn't at war. Our soldiers are at war. America is at the mall.

TTURY3KRIFDQBOXIZA5FNMDUBM	im very superstitious but i have no dominant religion, my view is that religion is bull crap because basically there are so many.and i there are people who believe in there religion just as much as another person in theres then how are you supposed to tell which one is real? i play many instruments including guitar, piano, trumpet, ocarina, ukulele and i can sing.(not to sound arrogant,i really HATE arrogance!) i love Japanese animation and basically anything that has to do with japan especially feudal japan.music is basically everything else that takes up my being that my love of japan leaves empty. im a strategic thinker and my zodiac is a Pisces, my Chinese zodiac is a rat element, fire. in my opinion this is the best match-up of zodiacs even though my given element is water in american and my given element is fire in chinese. my preference of the elements is air if you think about it this element is dominant. "the air can churn the waters, extinguish flame,and erode the earth.

ZTGLSF2FTPYDC6N5OUM6RUBUMY	Have a question about wild or pet birds? Rescues, new additions, or "just wondering?" No honest question is a dumb question. Email me at gosgirl27@gmail.com and I will answer within 72 hours. If you have a bird-related emergency - wounded, orphaned, very ill or other dire situations - include the word "emergency" in the subject. The email will go straight to my priorities where I will answer right away if possible. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Obviously I cannot be there 24/7. I ALWAYS recommend taking the animal to a wildlife center instead of trying to rehabilitate it yourself. Technically speaking, holding a wild animal for longer than the time it takes you to get it to a wildlife rehabilitation center is illegal in many areas. Please know the laws that apply to you and abide by them. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Also: <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am from Jersey, train dogs and horses, and enjoy a variety of music (My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy, Bring Me The Horizon, Sleeping with Sirens, and Adam Lambert being in my top favorites).

ZXWUCBH2SNZPHKWLPWZ4B3YZVE	I've studied Martial Arts of all kinds as a hobby since I was young. I have 6 years of Shaolin Long Fist experience, 3 years of Wing Chun under 2 different Sifu, 1 year of Judo experience from two schools, some dabbling in other things, and I currently train in Muay Thai which I have found to be one of my greater passions in the martial arts. My Kru has a professional career of over 100 fights, most of which were fought in Thailand although he also competed in full contact Karate and Boxing, and trained a world Muay Thai champion as well. I'm very proud of my school and I will defend Muay Thai as the traditional martial art it really is, complete with illegal for competition attacks to the eyes and groin, whenever I see it accused of being "Just a sport."

LO7EV3F3E2UNMMYAUYITNYW4KQ	My name Annie, and everyone just calls me Annie. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am a 15-year-old (Yay -.-), I have the emotional maturity of a 9-year-old, and the musculoskeletal health of a 76-year-old. I live in some depressing place called Melbourne, Australia. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I can be really sarcastic, tactless, and blunt, and most of the time I don’t mean to be. I’m amused far too easily and I have (what I believe to be) an awesome sense of humour. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> When I meet people, I take what kind of music they like into too much consideration. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Some of the things that I take into high regard are Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars (in particular Revenge of the Sith- Episode III), Doctor Who and most video games in general. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> And although I kind of build the image that I that I am weak, and that I fail in almost any kind of sporting exercise other than ping pong. I can assure you that I am not a 56 year old man living in his parents basement. Seriously though...

DKJM3DPVXQJBAPFBGMJ27OESQU	Salam to all my brothers and sisters. Reverted 01/05/07. Happy and Proud. <br> <br/> --------------------------------------... <br> <br/> It is very important that every Muslim believe that there is going to be a life after death. We have to bear in mind that this life on earth is short. We must try not to become too attached to this world because here will end. Hereafter will come and that's going to be forever and ever. Therefore, we must try to make our hereafter, by leading our life according to Allah Ta'ala's comands and the Sunnah by our beloved prohet Muhammad (PBUH). =)

DGQHQHLRHQ22KPXQD3ELLOMKPE	Ted Pollock was born in the Bronx, New York City, on April 28th, 1944. His education and career – Art (HS of Music & Art), Engineering (City College of New York and New York University), and Management Consulting – in no way promoted his interest in astronomy and cosmology. Rather, it was part of his fabric from his earliest days.

DFUGJDMUEBHVPCBZIXTI2BGZKU	Buddhist Background: <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Practitioner, student for 20+ yrs since 3. I also went to Catholic school k-8, but eventually put my entire heart in Buddhism. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I grew up studying sutras, meditation, recitations, and the explanations and teachings zby the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua. The Master taught Buddhism as a whole, just as the Buddha did. He didn't teach Chinese Buddhism, though he was a monk from China. He didn't teach a sect either. He taught all schools of Buddhism as one big school. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> The Master was extraordinary, never wavering in conduct, precepts & teachings. He slept sitting up, could meditate for weeks at a time, ate one meal a day, lectured many times a day, and taught by example through his own cultivation. He fit the standards of a genuine teacher, and certainly demonstrated enlightenment/wisdom, yet oh so humble. I haven't found another teacher that could speak the Dharma in depth/consistency like he did. <a href="http://www.drba.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.drba.org</a>

They are not the only group of people who protect me and my country.

ADQHMBKGJYWGW6YYKY6SQZHASI	Hello! I am a newlywed from Tampa who loves talking about baseball, football, weddings, food, traveling and education. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I LOVE baseball and going to Rays games with my husband! I just made my first trip to Yankee Stadium (had to see it before they tore it down) to see the Rays take on the Yankees on July 8. Unfortunatley, the Rays lost but it was an awesome experience! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Some of my greatest childhood memories are going to Bucs games with my Dad at the Old Sombrero,.......... although I have many new memories at Raymond James! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I love Tampa sports, although we have not always been blessed with the great zones (unlike my husband who was born and raised in Boston)! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Im just enjoying life and the Summer...until school starts again (2nd grade teacher).

ANTM7JB5WIS2K2SY2F456EJATI	You want to know about me? Ha! I'm still finding out about me! Here's basics, though... <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm old enough to know better, and young enough not to give a damn. <br> <br/> I live somewhere in Florida, there's probably enough clues in some of my posts to give a better idea of where. <br> <br/> I grew up around reptiles, can't remember a time we didn't have any, and it was only a matter of time until my family got into alligators, in all, I've spent most (20 years) of my life working directly with alligators. <br> <br/> I worked for 2 years on a nature tour boat, best job in the wozrld. <br> <br/> A teacher in high school said that I was a fountain of useless knowledge, and it was a shame I'd never be able to use it in the real world. What's a shame is that a -teacher- of all professions would believe that there is a such thing as useless knowledge. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If my answers hurt your feelings, I'm soooo verrry sorry.... not. I answer 'em how I see 'em, folks, if you ask a stupid question, I WILL give a stupid answer. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Tough cookies
