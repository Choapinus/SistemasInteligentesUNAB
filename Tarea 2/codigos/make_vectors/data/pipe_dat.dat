I bought it out of the classified ads for $100 including the monitor and a huge dot matrix printer. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am currently attending ITT Tech's School of Information Technology. I have a GPA of 3.0 and I am majoring in Computer Network Systems; although, my first passion is for computer repair and I am very good at it. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am looking forward to putting the knowledge I have gained over the years to good use here on Yahoo!

KY2F3RLNZVK2QN6NEMT5L4KBWU	We inherent nothing from our ancestors, we only take from our children. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> We are "all" related.All life forms on this planet known as Earth, we call Turtle Island, are related. The cradle of life and mankind. From the smallest invisible strand of DNA to the edge of space and everything in between, we need ... need each other just to exist. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> To promote this understanding I beleive in the development of good human beings to prepare a path for the 7th generation to come. That's seven generations from each individual, the children you will most likely never see, but they will know of you ... and the good steward you are ... if you are responsible now. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> It is in your power ... our power. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Let us live to give them a better world than the one we received ... that they live in peace and happiness, without war or want. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> To all our relations, walk in beauty. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Iroqvn!

SVZVMAT2NGUPJUBTRJXYXK2FNE	Dear Friend, <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you are reading this, you have most likely been intrigued, agitated, or pleased by one of my answers or inquires. Please know any answer I offer is for the sole ambition of edifying the asker. I only answer questions that I discern as being worth replying to. <br> <br/> As a devout and blessed Seventh-Day Adventist Christian, I often can be found typing long, thorough epistles in the Religion & Spirituality section. I highly value the divinely inspired Word of God, so I will not hesitate to reprimand any accusations or derogations at the Bible offered by an inconsiderate individual. <br> <br/> I am an experienced musician who greatly appreciates classical piano music. I frequently perform either by singing or playing. Music is an intricate part of my life. <br> <br/> Another love of mine is literature. I am currently writing my own historical novel and have read hundreds of the greatest literary works ever written. <br> <br/> I am home-schooled and would love to come in contact with other H.S.

JFGJIEXGVWITSRPOIUX7TB7FAQ	I became interested in alternative and complimentary care in 1995 when allopathic medicine failed me. Like most, I waited to use it as a last resort. It took herbal therapies less than one week to balance what three months of allopathic treatments couldn't -- without the side effects. The more I experienced the effectiveness of ACM and tried different therapies, the more I wanted to learn (and am still learning). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In 2002, my best friend and I founded Alternative Measures for the purpose of providing and integrating multidisciplinary holistic care services in Northwest Ohio. We believe that the zgreatest healing occurs when we take an active role in our own well-being. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you have any questions concerning complimentary and alternative care, or would like to be included in our referral network, please feel free to email us. If we can't answer, chances are we can refer you to someone who can! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My philosophy: I refuse to tiptoe quietly through life only to arrive safely at death.

All my family want to be the best they can. I have done my duty and I now want to learn more, keep going to school and better myself.

FLEECR5DK7QREUWRSVTQGUYBLM	Hello. My name is Jess Mann. I'm 21, and a professional freelance software developer. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I started programming when I was about 12 (as I recall), and I haven't really stopped since. I worked for a short time as a Real Estate Salesperson in Manhattan, and then for 6 months as a System Admin on Wall St. Since then, I've started freelancing online, which I really enjoy; I have a number of clients who really love working with me, a better income than I had salaried before, and (most importantly) the flexibility to actually live my life the way I want to. I'm building a team now, and I have considered starting up my own company many years down the road. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you have a project you're interested in discussing with me, I would be more than happy to hear about it. I do most of my work in PHP, Javascript and Java, but my skillset extends outside the scope of this bio. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Check out my website for more info: <a href="http://jess-mann.com" rel="nofollow">http://jess-mann.com</a> <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Thanks! <br> <br/> -Jess

So I developed somewhat of unique sense of humor and its sort of reflected in the questions I post, so for the most part I stay in in the humor and jokes section. If you don't like my questions/answers or you dont find them funny, please, please....don't tell me about it because I don't wanna hear that crap!!! lol.

The place is called Kanye. That was a year ago....and now, I'm presently in the Philippines taking 1st year nursing here at AUP. So please, don't ever ask me where I'm from, 'coz that's a very hard question to answer!!! =)

You're welcomed to email me questions. The only people I won't help are those who post their homework assignments and are here for answers rather than understanding of the material (What good does THAT do, anyway?) and of course, people who ask questions that are outside of my expertise. I'm not afraid to say "I don't know".

I was born and raised here, but housing prices have gone though the roof, there are physician jobs anywhere, and geez, other places have nice weather too! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm answering questions as a way of saying "thanks" to all those people who regularly update gas prices on gasbuddy.com (or for me sanjosegasprices.com) allowing myself and others like me that don't have money or don't want to pay top dollar for gas, the chance to go bargain hunting. (Yes, it's not just housing that's expensive here...sigh.) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> If you learned something useful from me, I hope you will pass your insight on to someone else, be it gas prices, the next Super Bowl champ, or some tidbit of info that could lead to a more fulfilling life...=)

VKAVEV4SBTMP26HOQW34EXPU3E	What do you want to know? I'm over 50 but you'd never know it. I live in southwest Florida and love it. Some of my passions would include, in no particular order, my family and friends, singing karaoke, shooting, Star Trek, cooking, building things, the beach, collecting stuff, but mostly doing anything (or nothing) with my wife. I am an NRA qualified instructor. One day I hope to go into a family business with my son. I consider myself a Christian but I'm not overly religeous. I'm VERY concerned about the path our country is taking but I don't think I'm too political either. I guess I'm just a "live and let live" kind of guy, unless you screw with me or mine. I like meeting new people which is why I'm here. So stop by, introduce yourself, maybe we'll find we have something in common. Peace.

I'm here to meet great people and have time pass faster by having fun... ^_^

PGMM4FK4W7TDRVLWNEJUB5YABM	The picture I use is Odin. Not to suggest any Pagan religious beliefs on my part, just a love of mythology, and a symbol of wisdom. (Though personally, I find Loki more interesting). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Let's just clear up a few misconceptions right now, I am not a zMuslim, a Mexican, or a Pagan. Because I stand up for these people, it has been assumed that I am one of them. I am an atheist, and American (of Polish, Germanic, and native american indian descent), a Leftist. I hate Israel though I am not anti-semetic, anymore than hating Nazis makes me anti-Germany. I feel that Muslims should be treated as human beings, but I'm not planning a Jihad against all western civilization so relax guys...

I could give you a list of how i love hanging out with friends, and all the stuff people always type, but I'm hoping you can assume that, because Im a social person. I'm curious and I like to discover things in my own way. Even when I do find something out, I try to look at it from another perspective. I'm interested in all sorts of art, and anything having to do with Japan. I'm also really into social science, and philosophy. I space out a lot, and I'm a fairly deep thinker.

Q2CFQBTRG2J33WWPRZ4YOU5ERI	My parents both died within 12 months of each other (1997-1998) of HIV. My siblings and I were placed with a relative's family, a distant uncle who said he could take us in. I was preparing for my A level exams then and not long after I took them. My uncle raped me over several weeks till I run away and went to the city, Harare. There I had to live and that is when I was introduced to some girls. 1998. My uncle and his wife died in 2001. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In 2000 I went to South Africa and found that I could earn more money for doing very little. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In Durban the police were the main customers. Cape Town was good. Joburg I did not like. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> In 2002 I entered the UK worked there till end of October 2005 in Slough area. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Average earnings without a minder GBP 6000 per month tax free.

QVAO7K5S7EGPE564S25P5PAZHQ	Student: Grand Cannyon University <br> <br/> Mother: 3 girls ages 15, 12 and 10. <br> <br/> Religion: Seventh Day Sinners Annonymous <br> <br/> Passtime: Runescape, Facebook, YA. <br> <br/> Relationship status: Happily married since June 6, 1999. <br> <br/> Husband job: State-wide and neighboring states truck driver. <br> <br/> I met my husband at a University that neither of us were students at. He came to make a friend. I came because my sister invited me to a prayer conference. I caught his eye by suprise when I was signing "In Moments Like These" in Sign Languagze. He thought he knew everyone in the county who could sign as his parents are both deaf. He was confused that he never met me. It was love at first sight, well pretty much. He told me he loved me about a month later in an evening phone conversation, and I quickly hung up. A few days later I was returning home from the park and it suddenly hit me that I also loved him. It was a very whimsical feeling.

QD4WYLAR3Z7T4ESESM7FFTO5HQ	Hi, my name is Ally. :) <br> <br/> And I'm sixteen years old. <br> <br/> Born on the 25th of January 1997. <br> <br/> Lives in a small town in Virginia. <br> <br/> I'm a shy, sensitive, and quiet girl. <br> <br/> People usually take me for granted. <br> <br/> Some people have told me that I can never say "no" to any question. <br> <br/> One of the staff at school has told me that I need to stop being so nice, and actually stand up for myself. But I just can't do it. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> My two favorite singers are: <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Kevin Bard (Stereo Skyline) <br> <br/> & Bobby Mares (My Genuine Find). <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I would do almost anything to show how much I love Kevin. <3 <br> <br/> I wouldn't do much for Bobby since I'm not in love with him like I am with Kevin. But I do really love Bobby! :) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Sorry if I've ever been a little rude on here. I've just been having a rough time lately. I'm actually really nice. Everyone who knows me will say the same thing. But I'm trying to stay as positive as I possibly can. <3

QMWCAGJWAYJTJTVCJWTTZSQPCA	I'm Amanda, I'm 22. My husband Shawn was in the Army and was killed in Iraq over two years ago & that's been undescribably hard. I'm now with a wonderful man named Henry & we have a beautiful baby girl together named Cadence. Henry saved me from myself & taught me to live again & Cadence has healed places in me that I thought could never be fixed, places I didn't even know were broken. I love Henry & Cadence more than anything & I would be lost without them. I know without a doubt that Shawn sent them to me & that he's watching over all of us from Heaven. That's about it I guess. Being a Mommy takes up most of my time so I'm not online much. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Henry- I love you, most I win. You're the one. You are my best friend & always will be. I wouldn't be here today without you. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Cadence- You are beautiful & I love watching you grow (although I wish you'd slow down!) & learn new things. I love you, my baby girl. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Shawn- I miss & love you every day, forever. Thank you, for everything.

I left the “The Nursery” at 12. I don’t like it on the “Outside“. It is not right. The Emperor has his own vision on his way of doing things. The paths he takes are wrong and inhumane.

I have always loved children and always felt like it was my calling in life to be a stay at home mom. Life didn't seem to go that way for many years. I was married at the age of 21 and had a long battle with infertility. Finally through IVF I was able to conceive our son. I have had lots of experience with children through babysitting, volunteer work, and I operated a day care. After a long hard road I am finally able to raise a child of my own. He is the biggest blessing in my life and brings me such joy. We live in central Texas and we are new to the area. I grew up in Oregon and lived most of my married life in Southern California. Overall, I am a happy person with a casual/kick back personality, who loves people.

U5OLZUX4VD2SOVDYGCQ5D4C6FA	I am friendly almost all the time. I am very choosy when it comes to friends. As a result I don't have a lot of them, which is good depending on how you look at it. I have a lot of time to myself and the freinds I have don't feel neglected, since they are also accommodated at no one's expense. The majority of my friends are girls ~ infact I don't seriously recall any male, that I can call a serious friend. However, when it comes to girls one needs to be very cautious and watch where one stands. You learn a lot to have and be close to FRIENDS who are girls. You learn a lot even about them, and also about your spouse or fiance`. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am pursuing a career in Engineering ~ this is not important, however I thought it good to mention it. I love anything that has got to do with mathematics~I just do! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I also like English football. My best team in Europe is Arsenal(The GUNNERS) - they might not have won anything last season and again this season, but they are still the best.

WCMPMXDSHNY4OYHLC5TTYSIEEM	I was a competitive swimmer, I was home schooled all my life. I'm now in University in Budapest, Hungary, studying psychology. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> FAQ: <br> <br/> What qualifications do your parents have for teaching? <br> <br/> Well, while both my parents happen to be teachers, that doesn't mean that you've got to have some sort of qualification to educate your own! You potty-trained them, right? Well if you're confident, with the right books, you can do anything. :) <br> <br/> <br> <br/> What curriculum did my parents use when I was growing up? <br> <br/> Well, my mom chose many different books- she read up on each one and chose what she felt was best for me. Saxon math, however, was the best! It's a great, solid math foundation. I worked Saxon all the way through Algebra II. When it came time for high school, I chose to do correspondence courses through Oak Meadows School, Laurel Springs School, and Nebraska University. Most of them provide courses for K thru 12. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Was it hard, adjusting to Uni life? <br> <br/> Not really, but I miss my mom! We talk a lot. :P

If you do the wiping up, the comforting, the hugging, the kissing of boo-boos, and the all of the other stuff that comes with motherhood...then you are the REAL mom. I live in western Illinois - out on the prairie, but I grew up in a big city.

GBPL5G4VN6D4MPONTU3YOTWK7E	I am a freshman Trumpet player who's life is based around jazz. My cousin is also a trumpet player(2 grades higher) who had me listen to this artist Maynard Ferguson. When i heard it i knew i needed to play it. That particular song was Birdland(i know every arrangement and can play it on guitar, keyboard, and of course trumpet). But now 2 years later i have played two of his songs in jazz band. But recently was given a whole book of some of his music. Some of which are my favorites(Chameleon,Maria, Gospel John, La fiesta, Mister mellow and more).My range is an E flat/ F above the staff(same as my cousin who is a junior in high school). I can play those songs but some notes exceed my range at the moment. At times while im playing, i feel like im not good enough for most jazz bands. I feel i make to any beginner mistakes. i was told by a near by band teacher i have an excellent tone, but i'm still not sure i'm good.

GIJUTZTMGXMTEGQ4S6SJKAOOMY	I am a student of life. I study within a formal college setting and within the field of Biology.

GRNFYSFBOCRUDVGN4SY6GJIPGM	Hello <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I'm a 14 year old girl from sunny England. My dream is to one day be a comedian or a photographer. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I suppose you could describe me as a bit sociably awkward but it's something I'm trying to improve as I find that it can hold me back in some parts of life. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am fond of animals and have a cat, a rabbit and one fish (the last of 7). When I'm older I would love a dog. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I choose not to make my profile private so that people can read my questions and answers. I hope this allows you to understand my personality better. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I mostly hang around in the Polls and Survey and Teen and Preteen sections. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> I am a major Sims 3 player and can answer most Sims 3 questions, unless they are relating to technical issues because I can barely handle them myself! <br> <br/> <br> <br/> ๔คภςєг เภ tђє гคเภ

We were the typical single family. Much of my childhood was spent around the docks and fishing boats of Tirur and Ponnani. In 1988, my mother decided to give me a better environment. After a few months, we packed up and moved to Chennai. Chennai a great City with great people and lovely environment was no surprise became the best choice for us. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Broadway, Chennai remained my locality through my secondary school years.

If you don't agree with it, fine, but doesn't mean I'm wrong. <br> <br/> <br> <br/> Other than that, I'm hillary, from Ontario, Canada :) I can be very nice when it comes to REAL questions.

Some of my hobbies include football,baseball,boxing,poetry,and hanging out with friends. I trust everyone at first until they mess it up and hurt me. I am very easy to talk to and don't judge anyone about what they tell me. If anyone ever needs to talk I'm here and I promise whatever you say will stay between us. I love my girlfriend :) Feel free to message me I don't bite ;)

IWBPGS4BD5N6H7MTLTADJFRQKE	Hello Everyone <br> <br/> First of all, dont hate it when you get a blunt answer for a stupid question. You should know what your getting yourself into when you ask a dumb question. Especially a pregnancy questions! Ive been on Yahoo for years now, and I love it. <br> <br/> I am a new mother and I love it, my baby girl is my world; she is the best thing that has ever happened to me and I love that even though she came unexpectedly, she is perfect and I wouldnt want it anyother way. I am also married to a wonderful man who is in the Air Force (Military I knzow) but he is an amazing guy, respectful and charming. So to all you ladies out there afraid to marry a man in the military because of them cheating or divorcing you, not all the men in the military are horrible because some really do care. So because he is in the military we are far from home. We are originally from Florida and now live in sucky Great Falls Montana! So the extra time that I have, I am on here answering questions away, which I enjoy. <br> <br/> :D

AEUUAGTJOQ7LCZHYQHLB2ROUTM	Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.

AEVS4M3ISU4JQS2VORMO2GH65I	I am a 39 yr old white hetero female who wants to grow up to be a 21 yr old black gay male. I love dogs more than people and my teenaged son thinks I'm crazy (he's probably right but how else can i survive parenting a teen?). My super power is my singing and dancing because whenever i do it i feel happy, and my super weakness is also my singing and dancing because i'm really a terrible singer and dancer. I wish that all people were poor, fat and ugly because then maybe they wouldn't be such superficial asses. I wish that sidewalks were friendlier places to be and that customer service reps could smile once in a while and do something other than read aloud from the service manual. I can't go five minutes without a book to read and i want to marry the stand up comic Zach Galifianakis if he will have me. If he won't marry me, I'll take David Cross. I love Canada and Subarus and really raunchy comedy. If you can set me up with either of my fantasy men, please let me know.

My mother signed over custody of my 12 year old sister, Gracie, when I turned 18, when she realized she could not adequately care for her. I've been married to my husband, Ethan, who I met in high school, for a year now and I have a wonderful four year old stepson, Tate. Ethan has primary custody of Tate, something he worked very hard for, and though we are young and some call our family structure unconventional, we really arent that different from any other family.
